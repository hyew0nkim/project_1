            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Korea's history is marked by a series of dynasties, each leaving a significant imprint on the nation's culture. The Three Kingdoms Period (57 BC – 668 AD) saw the rise of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, which were later unified under the Silla Kingdom. The Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) followed, known for its advancements in ceramics and Buddhism. The subsequent Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897) established Confucianism as the state ideology and is renowned for its cultural achievements, including the creation of the Korean script, Hangul. These historical periods have contributed to a rich tapestry of cultural heritage that is evident in Korea's numerous palaces, temples, and artifacts.</p>
